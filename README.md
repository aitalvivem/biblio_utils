# biblio_utils
biblio_utils is a library of php tools that aims to simplify the handling of lexicograficals data.

Its first goal is to gather the necessary tools to create a serious-game to create senses for lexems. But, in a long-term, it aims too gather all the functions that could be used to manage the handling of lexicograficals data between a software, its database and the Wikidata API.

This library contains two class of objects, one to communicate with the API and the other one to communicate with the database. It also contains generals functions using both classes.
